    /**
     * The Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of addresses.
     * **Geocoding** is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic
     * coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or
     * position the map. **Reverse geocoding** is the process of converting geographic coordinates
     * into a human-readable address. You can also use the Geocoding API to find the address for a
     * given place ID. To see countries currently supported by the Google Maps Platform Geocoding
     * API, please consult the [Google Maps coverage
     * data](https://developers.google.com/maps/coverage). The accuracy of geocoded locations may
     * vary per country, so you should consider using the returned `location_type` field to
     * determine if a good enough match has been found for the purposes of your application. Please
     * note that the availability of geocoding data depends on our contracts with data providers, so
     * it is subject to change.
     * @param  address  Optional parameter: The street address or plus code that you want to
     *         geocode. Specify addresses in accordance with the format used by the national postal
     *         service of the country concerned. Additional address elements such as business names
     *         and unit, suite or floor numbers should be avoided. Street address elements should be
     *         delimited by spaces (shown here as url-escaped to `%20`): ```
     *         address=24%20Sussex%20Drive%20Ottawa%20ON ``` Format plus codes as shown here (plus
     *         signs are url-escaped to `%2B` and spaces are url-escaped to `%20`): - global code is
     *         a 4 character area code and 6 character or longer local code (`849VCWC8+R9` is
     *         `849VCWC8%2BR9`). - compound code is a 6 character or longer local code with an
     *         explicit location (`CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA` is
     *         `CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA`). &lt;div class="note"&gt;Note: At least one
     *         of `address` or `components` is required.&lt;/div&gt;
     * @param  bounds  Optional parameter: The bounding box of the viewport within which to bias
     *         geocode results more prominently. This parameter will only influence, not fully
     *         restrict, results from the geocoder.
     * @param  components  Optional parameter: A components filter with elements separated by a pipe
     *         (|). The components filter is also accepted as an optional parameter if an address is
     *         provided. Each element in the components filter consists of a `component:value` pair,
     *         and fully restricts the results from the geocoder. The components that can be
     *         filtered include: * `postal_code` matches `postal_code` and `postal_code_prefix`. *
     *         `country` matches a country name or a two letter ISO 3166-1 country code. The API
     *         follows the ISO standard for defining countries, and the filtering works best when
     *         using the corresponding ISO code of the country. &lt;aside
     *         class="note"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you receive unexpected results
     *         with a country code, verify that you are using a code which includes the countries,
     *         dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest you intend. You can
     *         find code information at Wikipedia: List of ISO 3166 country codes or the ISO Online
     *         Browsing Platform.&lt;/aside&gt; The following components may be used to influence
     *         results, but will not be enforced: * `route` matches the long or short name of a
     *         route. * `locality` matches against `locality` and `sublocality` types. *
     *         `administrative_area` matches all the `administrative_area` levels. Notes about
     *         component filtering: * Do not repeat these component filters in requests, or the API
     *         will return `INVALID_REQUEST`: * `country` * `postal_code` * `route` * If the request
     *         contains repeated component filters, the API evaluates those filters as an AND, not
     *         an OR. * Results are consistent with Google Maps, which occasionally yields
     *         unexpected `ZERO_RESULTS` responses. Using Place Autocomplete may provide better
     *         results in some use cases. To learn more, see [this
     *         FAQ](https://developers..google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/faq#trbl_component_filtering).
     *         * For each address component, either specify it in the address parameter or in a
     *         components filter, but not both. Specifying the same values in both may result in
     *         `ZERO_RESULTS`. &lt;div class="note"&gt;Note: At least one of `address` or
     *         `components` is required.&lt;/div&gt;
     * @param  latlng  Optional parameter: The street address that you want to geocode, in the
     *         format used by the national postal service of the country concerned. Additional
     *         address elements such as business names and unit, suite or floor numbers should be
     *         avoided.
     * @param  locationType  Optional parameter: A filter of one or more location types, separated
     *         by a pipe (`|`). If the parameter contains multiple location types, the API returns
     *         all addresses that match any of the types. A note about processing: The
     *         `location_type` parameter does not restrict the search to the specified location
     *         type(s). Rather, the `location_type` acts as a post-search filter: the API fetches
     *         all results for the specified latlng, then discards those results that do not match
     *         the specified location type(s). The following values are supported: * `APPROXIMATE`
     *         returns only the addresses that are characterized as approximate. *
     *         `GEOMETRIC_CENTER` returns only geometric centers of a location such as a polyline
     *         (for example, a street) or polygon (region). * `RANGE_INTERPOLATED` returns only the
     *         addresses that reflect an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two
     *         precise points (such as intersections). An interpolated range generally indicates
     *         that rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address. * `ROOFTOP` returns only
     *         the addresses for which Google has location information accurate down to street
     *         address precision.
     * @param  placeId  Optional parameter: A textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place,
     *         returned from a [Place
     *         Search](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search).
     *         For more information about place IDs, see the [place ID
     *         overview](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id).
     * @param  resultType  Optional parameter: A filter of one or more address types, separated by a
     *         pipe (|). If the parameter contains multiple address types, the API returns all
     *         addresses that match any of the types. A note about processing: The `result_type`
     *         parameter does not restrict the search to the specified address type(s). Rather, the
     *         `result_type` acts as a post-search filter: the API fetches all results for the
     *         specified `latlng`, then discards those results that do not match the specified
     *         address type(s).The following values are supported: * `administrative_area_level_1`
     *         indicates a first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United
     *         States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these
     *         administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1 * `short` names
     *         will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however
     *         this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and
     *         location data. * `administrative_area_level_2` indicates a second-order civil entity
     *         below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are
     *         counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. *
     *         `administrative_area_level_3` indicates a third-order civil entity below the country
     *         level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these
     *         administrative levels. * `administrative_area_level_4` indicates a fourth-order civil
     *         entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all
     *         nations exhibit these administrative levels. * `administrative_area_level_5`
     *         indicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a
     *         minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. *
     *         `airport` indicates an airport. * `colloquial_area` indicates a commonly-used
     *         alternative name for the entity. * `country` indicates the national political entity,
     *         and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder. * `intersection`
     *         indicates a major intersection, usually of two major roads. * `locality` indicates an
     *         incorporated city or town political entity. * `natural_feature` indicates a prominent
     *         natural feature. * `neighborhood` indicates a named neighborhood * `park` indicates a
     *         named park. * `plus_code` indicates an encoded location reference, derived from
     *         latitude and longitude. Plus codes can be used as a replacement for street addresses
     *         in places where they do not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are
     *         not named). See [https://plus.codes/](https://plus.codes/) for details. *
     *         `point_of_interest` indicates a named point of interest. Typically, these "POI"s are
     *         prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as "Empire
     *         State Building" or "Eiffel Tower". * `political` indicates a political entity.
     *         Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration. * `postal_code`
     *         indicates a postal code as used to address postal mail within the country. *
     *         `premise` indicates a named location, usually a building or collection of buildings
     *         with a common name * `route` indicates a named route (such as "US 101"). *
     *         `street_address` indicates a precise street address. * `sublocality` indicates a
     *         first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the
     *         additional types: `sublocality_level_1` to `sublocality_level_5`. Each sublocality
     *         level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area. *
     *         `subpremise` indicates a first-order entity below a named location, usually a
     *         singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name
     * @param  language  Optional parameter: The language in which to return results. * See the
     *         [list of supported
     *         languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often
     *         updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive. * If `language`
     *         is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the
     *         `Accept-Language` header. * The API does its best to provide a street address that is
     *         readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
     *         addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
     *         necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the
     *         preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which
     *         is chosen from the first component. * If a name is not available in the preferred
     *         language, the API uses the closest match. * The preferred language has a small
     *         influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in
     *         which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
     *         on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
     *         valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms
     *         for street in Hungarian.
     * @param  region  Optional parameter: The region code, specified as a [ccTLD ("top-level
     *         domain")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains)
     *         two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some
     *         notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while
     *         its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of
     *         Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
     * @return    Returns the GeocodingResponse wrapped in ApiResponse response from the API call
     * @throws    ApiException    Represents error response from the server.
     * @throws    IOException    Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred.

     *         level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these
     *         administrative levels. * `administrative_area_level_4` indicates a fourth-order civil
     *         entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all
     *         nations exhibit these administrative levels. * `administrative_area_level_5`
     *         indicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a
     *         minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. *
     *         `airport` indicates an airport. * `colloquial_area` indicates a commonly-used
     *         alternative name for the entity. * `country` indicates the national political entity,
     *         and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder. * `intersection`
     *         indicates a major intersection, usually of two major roads. * `locality` indicates an
     *         incorporated city or town political entity. * `natural_feature` indicates a prominent
     *         natural feature. * `neighborhood` indicates a named neighborhood * `park` indicates a
     *         named park. * `plus_code` indicates an encoded location reference, derived from
     *         latitude and longitude. Plus codes can be used as a replacement for street addresses
     *         in places where they do not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are
     *         not named). See [https://plus.codes/](https://plus.codes/) for details. *
     *         `point_of_interest` indicates a named point of interest. Typically, these "POI"s are
     *         prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as "Empire
     *         State Building" or "Eiffel Tower". * `political` indicates a political entity.
     *         Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration. * `postal_code`
     *         indicates a postal code as used to address postal mail within the country. *
     *         `premise` indicates a named location, usually a building or collection of buildings
     *         with a common name * `route` indicates a named route (such as "US 101"). *
     *         `street_address` indicates a precise street address. * `sublocality` indicates a
     *         first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the
     *         additional types: `sublocality_level_1` to `sublocality_level_5`. Each sublocality
     *         level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area. *
     *         `subpremise` indicates a first-order entity below a named location, usually a
     *         singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name
     * @param  language  Optional parameter: The language in which to return results. * See the
     *         [list of supported
     *         languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often
     *         updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive. * If `language`
     *         is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the
     *         `Accept-Language` header. * The API does its best to provide a street address that is
     *         readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
     *         addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
     *         necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the
     *         preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which
     *         is chosen from the first component. * If a name is not available in the preferred
     *         language, the API uses the closest match. * The preferred language has a small
     *         influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in
     *         which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
     *         on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
     *         valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms
     *         for street in Hungarian.
     * @param  region  Optional parameter: The region code, specified as a [ccTLD ("top-level
     *         domain")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains)
     *         two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some
     *         notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while
     *         its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of
     *         Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
     * @return    Returns the GeocodingResponse wrapped in ApiResponse response from the API call
