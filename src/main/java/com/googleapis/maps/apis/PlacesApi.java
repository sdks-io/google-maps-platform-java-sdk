     * The Places API is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests. Places
     * are defined within this API as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of
     * interest.
     * @param  placeId  Required parameter: A textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place,
     *         returned from a [Place
     *         Search](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search).
     *         For more information about place IDs, see the [place ID
     *         overview](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id).
     * @param  fields  Optional parameter: &lt;div class="caution"&gt; Caution: Place Search
     *         requests and Place Details requests do not return the same fields. Place Search
     *         requests return a subset of the fields that are returned by Place Details requests.
     *         If the field you want is not returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to
     *         get a &lt;code&gt;place_id&lt;/code&gt;, then use that Place ID to make a Place
     *         Details request. For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a Place
     *         Search request, see &lt;a
     *         href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields#places-api-fields-support"&gt;Places
     *         API fields support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt; Use the fields parameter to specify a
     *         comma-separated list of place data types to return. For example:
     *         `fields=formatted_address,name,geometry`. Use a forward slash when specifying
     *         compound values. For example: `opening_hours/open_now`. Fields are divided into three
     *         billing categories: Basic, Contact, and Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base
     *         rate, and incur no additional charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a
     *         higher rate. See the [pricing
     *         sheet](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing/)
     *         for more information. Attributions, `html_attributions`, are always returned with
     *         every call, regardless of whether the field has been requested. **Basic** The Basic
     *         category includes the following fields: `address_components`, `adr_address`,
     *         `business_status`, `formatted_address`, `geometry`, `icon`, `icon_mask_base_uri`,
     *         `icon_background_color`, `name`, `permanently_closed`
     *         ([deprecated](https://developers.google.com/maps/deprecations)), `photo`, `place_id`,
     *         `plus_code`, `type`, `url`, `utc_offset`, `vicinity`,
     *         `wheelchair_accessible_entrance`. **Contact** The Contact category includes the
     *         following fields: `current_opening_hours`, `formatted_phone_number`,
     *         `international_phone_number`, `opening_hours`, `secondary_opening_hours`, `website`
     *         **Atmosphere** The Atmosphere category includes the following fields:
     *         `curbside_pickup`, `delivery`, `dine_in`, `editorial_summary`, `price_level`,
     *         `rating`, `reservable`, `reviews`, `serves_beer`, `serves_breakfast`,
     *         `serves_brunch`, `serves_dinner`, `serves_lunch`, `serves_vegetarian_food`,
     *         `serves_wine`, `takeout`, `user_ratings_total`.
     * @param  sessiontoken  Optional parameter: A random string which identifies an autocomplete
     *         [session](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#session_tokens)
     *         for billing purposes. The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and
     *         concludes when they select a place and a call to Place Details is made. Each session
     *         can have multiple queries, followed by one place selection. The API key(s) used for
     *         each request within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project.
     *         Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a
     *         fresh token for each session. If the `sessiontoken` parameter is omitted, or if you
     *         reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided
     *         (each request is billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: - Use
     *         session tokens for all autocomplete sessions. - Generate a fresh token for each
     *         session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. - Ensure that the API key(s) used for
     *         all Place Autocomplete and Place Details requests within a session belong to the same
     *         Cloud Console project. - Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session.
     *         Using the same token for more than one session will result in each request being
     *         billed individually.
     * @param  language  Optional parameter: The language in which to return results. * See the
     *         [list of supported
     *         languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often
     *         updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive. * If `language`
     *         is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the
     *         `Accept-Language` header. * The API does its best to provide a street address that is
     *         readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
     *         addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
     *         necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the
     *         preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which
     *         is chosen from the first component. * If a name is not available in the preferred
     *         language, the API uses the closest match. * The preferred language has a small
     *         influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in
     *         which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
     *         on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
     *         valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms
     *         for street in Hungarian.
     * @param  region  Optional parameter: The region code, specified as a [ccTLD ("top-level
     *         domain")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains)
     *         two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some
     *         notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while
     *         its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of
     *         Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
     * @param  reviewsSort  Optional parameter: The sorting method to use when returning reviews.
     *         Can be set to `most_relevant` (default) or `newest`. - For `most_relevant` (default),
     *         reviews are sorted by relevance; the service will bias the results to return reviews
     *         originally written in the preferred language. - For `newest`, reviews are sorted in
     *         chronological order; the preferred language does not affect the sort order. Google
     *         recommends that you display how the reviews are being sorted to the end user.
     * @param  reviewsNoTranslations  Optional parameter: Specify `reviews_no_translations=true` to
     *         disable translation of reviews; specify `reviews_no_translations=false` to enable
     *         translation of reviews. Reviews are returned in their original language. If omitted,
     *         or passed with no value, translation of reviews is enabled. If the `language`
     *         parameter was specified in the request, use the specified language as the preferred
     *         language for translation. If `language` is omitted, the API attempts to use the
     *         `Accept-Language` header as the preferred language.
     * @return    Returns the PlacesDetailsResponse wrapped in ApiResponse response from the API call
     * @throws    ApiException    Represents error response from the server.
     * @throws    IOException    Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred.

     * Places text data, such as a name, address, or phone number. The request must be a string. A
     * Find Place request using non-string data such as a lat/lng coordinate or plus code generates
     * an error. &lt;div class="note"&gt;Note: If you omit the fields parameter from a Find Place request,
     * only the place_id for the result will be returned.&lt;/div&gt;.
     * @param  input  Required parameter: The text string on which to search, for example:
     *         "restaurant" or "123 Main Street". This must be a place name, address, or category of
     *         establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors and are not guaranteed
     *         to return valid results. The Places API will return candidate matches based on this
     *         string and order the results based on their perceived relevance.
     * @param  inputtype  Required parameter: The type of input. This can be one of either
     *         `textquery` or `phonenumber`. Phone numbers must be in international format (prefixed
     *         by a plus sign ("+"), followed by the country code, then the phone number itself).
     *         See [E.164 ITU recommendation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) for more
     *         information.
     * @param  fields  Optional parameter: &lt;div class="caution"&gt; Caution: Place Search
     *         requests and Place Details requests do not return the same fields. Place Search
     *         requests return a subset of the fields that are returned by Place Details requests.
     *         If the field you want is not returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to
     *         get a &lt;code&gt;place_id&lt;/code&gt;, then use that Place ID to make a Place
     *         Details request. For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a Place
     *         Search request, see &lt;a

     *         API fields support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt; Use the fields parameter to specify a
     *         comma-separated list of place data types to return. For example:
     *         `fields=formatted_address,name,geometry`. Use a forward slash when specifying
     *         compound values. For example: `opening_hours/open_now`. Fields are divided into three
     *         billing categories: Basic, Contact, and Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base
     *         rate, and incur no additional charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a
     *         higher rate. See the [pricing
     *         sheet](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing/)
     *         for more information. Attributions, `html_attributions`, are always returned with
     *         every call, regardless of whether the field has been requested. **Basic** The Basic
     *         category includes the following fields: `address_components`, `adr_address`,
     *         `business_status`, `formatted_address`, `geometry`, `icon`, `icon_mask_base_uri`,
     *         `icon_background_color`, `name`, `permanently_closed`
     *         ([deprecated](https://developers.google.com/maps/deprecations)), `photo`, `place_id`,
     *         `plus_code`, `type`, `url`, `utc_offset`, `vicinity`,
     *         `wheelchair_accessible_entrance`. **Contact** The Contact category includes the
     *         following fields: `current_opening_hours`, `formatted_phone_number`,
     *         `international_phone_number`, `opening_hours`, `secondary_opening_hours`, `website`
     *         **Atmosphere** The Atmosphere category includes the following fields:
     *         `curbside_pickup`, `delivery`, `dine_in`, `editorial_summary`, `price_level`,
     *         `rating`, `reservable`, `reviews`, `serves_beer`, `serves_breakfast`,

     *         either a radius plus lat/lng, or two lat/lng pairs representing the points of a
     *         rectangle. If this parameter is not specified, the API uses IP address biasing by
     *         default. - IP bias: Instructs the API to use IP address biasing. Pass the string
     *         `ipbias` (this option has no additional parameters). - Circular: A string specifying
     *         radius in meters, plus lat/lng in decimal degrees. Use the following format:
     *         `circle:radius{@literal @}lat,lng`. - Rectangular: A string specifying two lat/lng
     *         pairs in decimal degrees, representing the south/west and north/east points of a
     *         rectangle. Use the following format:`rectangle:south,west|north,east`. Note that
     *         east/west values are wrapped to the range -180, 180, and north/south values are
     *         clamped to the range -90, 90.
     * @param  language  Optional parameter: The language in which to return results. * See the
     *         [list of supported
     *         languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often
     *         updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive. * If `language`
     *         is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the
     *         `Accept-Language` header. * The API does its best to provide a street address that is
     *         readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
     *         addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
     *         necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the
     *         preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which
     *         is chosen from the first component. * If a name is not available in the preferred
     *         language, the API uses the closest match. * The preferred language has a small
     *         influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in
     *         which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
     *         on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
     *         valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms

     *         and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`. * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters * Text
     *         Search: 50,000 meters
     * @param  keyword  Optional parameter: The text string on which to search, for example:
     *         "restaurant" or "123 Main Street". This must be a place name, address, or category of
     *         establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors and are not guaranteed

     *         based on this string and order the results based on their perceived relevance.
     *         Explicitly including location information using this parameter may conflict with the

     *         specified range. Valid values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most
     *         expensive), inclusive. The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from

     *         specified range. Valid values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most
     *         expensive), inclusive. The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from
     *         region to region.
     * @param  name  Optional parameter: Equivalent to `keyword`. Values in this field are combined
     *         with values in the `keyword` field and passed as part of the same search string.
     * @param  opennow  Optional parameter: Returns only those places that are open for business at
     *         the time the query is sent. Places that do not specify opening hours in the Google
     *         Places database will not be returned if you include this parameter in your query.

     *         Setting a `pagetoken` parameter will execute a search with the same parameters used
     *         previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be ignored.
     * @param  rankby  Optional parameter: Specifies the order in which results are listed. Possible
     *         values are: - `prominence` (default). This option sorts results based on their
     *         importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the set radius over nearby
     *         places that match but that are less prominent. Prominence can be affected by a
     *         place's ranking in Google's index, global popularity, and other factors. When
     *         prominence is specified, the `radius` parameter is required. - `distance`. This

     * A Nearby Search lets you search for places within a specified area. You can refine your
     * search request by supplying keywords or specifying the type of place you are searching for.
     * @param  location  Required parameter: The point around which to retrieve place information.
     *         This must be specified as `latitude,longitude`.
     * @param  radius  Required parameter: Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return
     *         place results. You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a `location` and
     *         a `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places service to _prefer_ showing
     *         results within that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be
     *         displayed. The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on

     *         parameter. * When using `rankby=distance`, the radius parameter will not be accepted,
     *         and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`. * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters * Text
     *         Search: 50,000 meters
     * @param  keyword  Optional parameter: The text string on which to search, for example:
     *         "restaurant" or "123 Main Street". This must be a place name, address, or category of
     *         establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors and are not guaranteed
     *         to return valid results. The Google Places service will return candidate matches
     *         based on this string and order the results based on their perceived relevance.
     *         Explicitly including location information using this parameter may conflict with the
     *         location, radius, and rankby parameters, causing unexpected results. If this
     *         parameter is omitted, places with a business_status of CLOSED_TEMPORARILY or
     *         CLOSED_PERMANENTLY will not be returned.
     * @param  maxprice  Optional parameter: Restricts results to only those places within the
     *         specified range. Valid values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most
     *         expensive), inclusive. The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from
     *         region to region.
     * @param  minprice  Optional parameter: Restricts results to only those places within the
     *         specified range. Valid values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most
     *         expensive), inclusive. The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from
     *         region to region.
     * @param  name  Optional parameter: Equivalent to `keyword`. Values in this field are combined
     *         with values in the `keyword` field and passed as part of the same search string.
     * @param  opennow  Optional parameter: Returns only those places that are open for business at
     *         the time the query is sent. Places that do not specify opening hours in the Google
     *         Places database will not be returned if you include this parameter in your query.
     * @param  pagetoken  Optional parameter: Returns up to 20 results from a previously run search.
     *         Setting a `pagetoken` parameter will execute a search with the same parameters used
     *         previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be ignored.
     * @param  rankby  Optional parameter: Specifies the order in which results are listed. Possible
     *         values are: - `prominence` (default). This option sorts results based on their
     *         importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the set radius over nearby
     *         places that match but that are less prominent. Prominence can be affected by a
     *         place's ranking in Google's index, global popularity, and other factors. When
     *         prominence is specified, the `radius` parameter is required. - `distance`. This
     *         option biases search results in ascending order by their distance from the specified
     *         location. When `distance` is specified, one or more of `keyword`, `name`, or `type`
     *         is required and `radius` is disallowed.

     *         type. Only one type may be specified. If more than one type is provided, all types

     * names. The search response will include a list of places. You can send a Place Details
     * request for more information about any of the places in the response.
     * @param  query  Required parameter: The text string on which to search, for example:
     *         "restaurant" or "123 Main Street". This must a place name, address, or category of
     *         establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors and are not guaranteed
     *         to return valid results. The Google Places service will return candidate matches
     *         based on this string and order the results based on their perceived relevance.
     * @param  radius  Required parameter: Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return
     *         place results. You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a `location` and
     *         a `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places service to _prefer_ showing
     *         results within that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be
     *         displayed. The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
     *         the type of search and other parameters. * Autocomplete: 50,000 meters * Nearby
     *         Search: * with `keyword` or `name`: 50,000 meters * without `keyword` or `name` * Up
     *         to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area density, independent of `rankby`
     *         parameter. * When using `rankby=distance`, the radius parameter will not be accepted,
     *         and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`. * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters * Text
     *         Search: 50,000 meters
     * @param  location  Optional parameter: The point around which to retrieve place information.
     *         This must be specified as `latitude,longitude`. &lt;div class="note"&gt;The
     *         &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; parameter may be overriden if the
     *         &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; contains an explicit location such as
     *         &lt;code&gt;Market in Barcelona&lt;/code&gt;. Using quotes around the query may also
     *         influence the weight given to the &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; and
     *         &lt;code&gt;radius&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
     * @param  maxprice  Optional parameter: Restricts results to only those places within the
     *         specified range. Valid values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most
     *         expensive), inclusive. The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from
     *         region to region.
     * @param  minprice  Optional parameter: Restricts results to only those places within the
     *         specified range. Valid values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most
     *         expensive), inclusive. The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from
     *         region to region.
     * @param  opennow  Optional parameter: Returns only those places that are open for business at
     *         the time the query is sent. Places that do not specify opening hours in the Google
     *         Places database will not be returned if you include this parameter in your query.
     * @param  pagetoken  Optional parameter: Returns up to 20 results from a previously run search.
     *         Setting a `pagetoken` parameter will execute a search with the same parameters used
     *         previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be ignored.
     * @param  type  Optional parameter: Restricts the results to places matching the specified
     *         type. Only one type may be specified. If more than one type is provided, all types
     *         following the first entry are ignored. * `type=hospital|pharmacy|doctor` becomes
     *         `type=hospital` * `type=hospital,pharmacy,doctor` is ignored entirely See the list of
     *         [supported
     *         types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types).
     *         &lt;div class="note"&gt;Note: Adding both `keyword` and `type` with the same value
     *         (`keyword=cafe&amp;type=cafe` or `keyword=parking&amp;type=parking`) can yield
     *         `ZERO_RESULTS`.&lt;/div&gt;
     * @param  language  Optional parameter: The language in which to return results. * See the
     *         [list of supported
     *         languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often
     *         updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive. * If `language`
     *         is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the
     *         `Accept-Language` header. * The API does its best to provide a street address that is
     *         readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
     *         addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
     *         necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the
     *         preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which
     *         is chosen from the first component. * If a name is not available in the preferred
     *         language, the API uses the closest match. * The preferred language has a small
     *         influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in
     *         which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
     *         on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
     *         valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms
     *         for street in Hungarian.
     * @param  region  Optional parameter: The region code, specified as a [ccTLD ("top-level
     *         domain")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains)
     *         two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some
     *         notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while
     *         its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of
     *         Great Britain and Northern Ireland").

     * The Query Autocomplete service can be used to provide a query prediction for text-based
     * geographic searches, by returning suggested queries as you type. The Query Autocomplete
     * service allows you to add on-the-fly geographic query predictions to your application.
     * Instead of searching for a specific location, a user can type in a categorical search, such
     * as "pizza near New York" and the service responds with a list of suggested queries matching
     * the string. As the Query Autocomplete service can match on both full words and substrings,
     * applications can send queries as the user types to provide on-the-fly predictions.
     * @param  input  Required parameter: The text string on which to search. The Place Autocomplete
     *         service will return candidate matches based on this string and order results based on
     *         their perceived relevance.
     * @param  radius  Required parameter: Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return
     *         place results. You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a `location` and
     *         a `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places service to _prefer_ showing
     *         results within that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be

     *         that the service uses to match predictions. For example, if the input is `Google` and
     *         the offset is 3, the service will match on `Goo`. The string determined by the offset
     *         is matched against the first word in the input term only. For example, if the input
     *         term is `Google abc` and the offset is 3, the service will attempt to match against
     *         `Goo abc`. If no offset is supplied, the service will use the whole term. The offset
     *         should generally be set to the position of the text caret.
     * @param  location  Optional parameter: The point around which to retrieve place information.
     *         This must be specified as `latitude,longitude`. &lt;div class="note"&gt;The

    /**
     * The Place Autocomplete service is a web service that returns place predictions in response to
     * an HTTP request. The request specifies a textual search string and optional geographic
     * bounds. The service can be used to provide autocomplete functionality for text-based
     * geographic searches, by returning places such as businesses, addresses and points of interest
     * as a user types. &lt;div class="note"&gt;Note: You can use Place Autocomplete even without a map.
     * If you do show a map, it must be a Google map. When you display predictions from the Place
     * Autocomplete service without a map, you must include the ['Powered by
     * Google'](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/policies#logo_requirementshttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/policies#logo_requirements)
     * logo.&lt;/div&gt; The Place Autocomplete service can match on full words and substrings, resolving
     * place names, addresses, and plus codes. Applications can therefore send queries as the user
     * types, to provide on-the-fly place predictions. The returned predictions are designed to be
     * presented to the user to aid them in selecting the desired place. You can send a [Place
     * Details](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#PlaceDetailsRequests)
     * request for more information about any of the places which are returned.
     * @param  input  Required parameter: The text string on which to search. The Place Autocomplete
     *         service will return candidate matches based on this string and order results based on
     *         their perceived relevance.
     * @param  radius  Required parameter: Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return
     *         place results. You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a `location` and
     *         a `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places service to _prefer_ showing
     *         results within that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be
     *         displayed. The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
     *         the type of search and other parameters. * Autocomplete: 50,000 meters * Nearby
     *         Search: * with `keyword` or `name`: 50,000 meters * without `keyword` or `name` * Up
     *         to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area density, independent of `rankby`
     *         parameter. * When using `rankby=distance`, the radius parameter will not be accepted,
     *         and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`. * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters * Text
     *         Search: 50,000 meters
     * @param  sessiontoken  Optional parameter: A random string which identifies an autocomplete
     *         [session](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#session_tokens)
     *         for billing purposes. The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and
     *         concludes when they select a place and a call to Place Details is made. Each session
     *         can have multiple queries, followed by one place selection. The API key(s) used for
     *         each request within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project.
     *         Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a
     *         fresh token for each session. If the `sessiontoken` parameter is omitted, or if you
     *         reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided
     *         (each request is billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: - Use
     *         session tokens for all autocomplete sessions. - Generate a fresh token for each
     *         session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. - Ensure that the API key(s) used for
     *         all Place Autocomplete and Place Details requests within a session belong to the same
     *         Cloud Console project. - Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session.
     *         Using the same token for more than one session will result in each request being
     *         billed individually.
     * @param  components  Optional parameter: A grouping of places to which you would like to
     *         restrict your results. Currently, you can use components to filter by up to 5
     *         countries. Countries must be passed as a two character, ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 compatible
     *         country code. For example: `components=country:fr` would restrict your results to
     *         places within France. Multiple countries must be passed as multiple `country:XX`
     *         filters, with the pipe character `|` as a separator. For example:
     *         `components=country:us|country:pr|country:vi|country:gu|country:mp` would restrict
     *         your results to places within the United States and its unincorporated organized
     *         territories. &lt;div class="note"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you
     *         receive unexpected results with a country code, verify that you are using a code
     *         which includes the countries, dependent territories, and special areas of
     *         geographical interest you intend. You can find code information at &lt;a
     *         href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes" target="blank"
     *         class="external"&gt;Wikipedia: List of ISO 3166 country codes&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a
     *         href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search" target="blank" class="external"&gt;ISO
     *         Online Browsing Platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
     * @param  strictbounds  Optional parameter: Returns only those places that are strictly within
     *         the region defined by `location` and `radius`. This is a restriction, rather than a
     *         bias, meaning that results outside this region will not be returned even if they
     *         match the user input.
     * @param  offset  Optional parameter: The position, in the input term, of the last character
     *         that the service uses to match predictions. For example, if the input is `Google` and
     *         the offset is 3, the service will match on `Goo`. The string determined by the offset
     *         is matched against the first word in the input term only. For example, if the input
     *         term is `Google abc` and the offset is 3, the service will attempt to match against
     *         `Goo abc`. If no offset is supplied, the service will use the whole term. The offset
     *         should generally be set to the position of the text caret.
     * @param  origin  Optional parameter: The origin point from which to calculate straight-line
     *         distance to the destination (returned as `distance_meters`). If this value is
     *         omitted, straight-line distance will not be returned. Must be specified as
     *         `latitude,longitude`.
     * @param  location  Optional parameter: The point around which to retrieve place information.
     *         This must be specified as `latitude,longitude`. The `radius` parameter must also be
     *         provided when specifying a location. If `radius` is not provided, the `location`
     *         parameter is ignored. &lt;div class="note"&gt;When using the Text Search API, the
     *         `location` parameter may be overriden if the `query` contains an explicit location
     *         such as `Market in Barcelona`.&lt;/div&gt;
     * @param  locationbias  Optional parameter: Prefer results in a specified area, by specifying
     *         either a radius plus lat/lng, or two lat/lng pairs representing the points of a
     *         rectangle. If this parameter is not specified, the API uses IP address biasing by
     *         default. - IP bias: Instructs the API to use IP address biasing. Pass the string
     *         `ipbias` (this option has no additional parameters). - Circular: A string specifying
     *         radius in meters, plus lat/lng in decimal degrees. Use the following format:
     *         `circle:radius{@literal @}lat,lng`. - Rectangular: A string specifying two lat/lng
     *         pairs in decimal degrees, representing the south/west and north/east points of a
     *         rectangle. Use the following format:`rectangle:south,west|north,east`. Note that
     *         east/west values are wrapped to the range -180, 180, and north/south values are
     *         clamped to the range -90, 90.
     * @param  locationrestriction  Optional parameter: Restrict results to a specified area, by
     *         specifying either a radius plus lat/lng, or two lat/lng pairs representing the points
     *         of a rectangle. - Circular: A string specifying radius in meters, plus lat/lng in
     *         decimal degrees. Use the following format: `circle:radius{@literal @}lat,lng`. -
     *         Rectangular: A string specifying two lat/lng pairs in decimal degrees, representing
     *         the south/west and north/east points of a rectangle. Use the following
     *         format:`rectangle:south,west|north,east`. Note that east/west values are wrapped to
     *         the range -180, 180, and north/south values are clamped to the range -90, 90.
     * @param  types  Optional parameter: You can restrict results from a Place Autocomplete request
     *         to be of a certain type by passing the `types` parameter. This parameter specifies a
     *         type or a type collection, as listed in [Place
     *         Types](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types). If nothing is
     *         specified, all types are returned. For the value of the `types` parameter you can
     *         specify either: * Up to five values from [Table
     *         1](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table1) or [Table
     *         2](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table2). For multiple
     *         values, separate each value with a `|` (vertical bar). For example:
     *         `types=book_store|cafe` * Any supported filter in [Table
     *         3](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table3). You can safely mix
     *         the `geocode` and `establishment` types. You cannot mix type collections (`address`,
     *         `(cities)` or `(regions)`) with any other type, or an error occurs. The request will
     *         be rejected with an `INVALID_REQUEST` error if: * More than five types are specified.
     *         * Any unrecognized types are present. * Any types from in [Table
     *         1](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table1) or [Table
     *         2](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table2) are mixed with any
     *         of the filters in [Table
     *         3](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table3).
     * @param  language  Optional parameter: The language in which to return results. * See the
     *         [list of supported
     *         languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often
     *         updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive. * If `language`
     *         is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the
     *         `Accept-Language` header. * The API does its best to provide a street address that is
     *         readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
     *         addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
     *         necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the
     *         preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which
     *         is chosen from the first component. * If a name is not available in the preferred
     *         language, the API uses the closest match. * The preferred language has a small
     *         influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in
     *         which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
     *         on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
     *         valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms
     *         for street in Hungarian.
     * @param  region  Optional parameter: The region code, specified as a [ccTLD ("top-level
     *         domain")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains)
     *         two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some
     *         notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while

    /**
     * The Place Autocomplete service is a web service that returns place predictions in response to
     * an HTTP request. The request specifies a textual search string and optional geographic
     * bounds. The service can be used to provide autocomplete functionality for text-based
     * geographic searches, by returning places such as businesses, addresses and points of interest
     * as a user types. &lt;div class="note"&gt;Note: You can use Place Autocomplete even without a map.
     * If you do show a map, it must be a Google map. When you display predictions from the Place
     * Autocomplete service without a map, you must include the ['Powered by
     * Google'](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/policies#logo_requirementshttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/policies#logo_requirements)
     * logo.&lt;/div&gt; The Place Autocomplete service can match on full words and substrings, resolving
     * place names, addresses, and plus codes. Applications can therefore send queries as the user
     * types, to provide on-the-fly place predictions. The returned predictions are designed to be
     * presented to the user to aid them in selecting the desired place. You can send a [Place
     * Details](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#PlaceDetailsRequests)
     * request for more information about any of the places which are returned.
     * @param  input  Required parameter: The text string on which to search. The Place Autocomplete
     *         service will return candidate matches based on this string and order results based on
     *         their perceived relevance.
     * @param  radius  Required parameter: Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return
     *         place results. You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a `location` and
     *         a `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places service to _prefer_ showing
     *         results within that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be
     *         displayed. The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
     *         the type of search and other parameters. * Autocomplete: 50,000 meters * Nearby
     *         Search: * with `keyword` or `name`: 50,000 meters * without `keyword` or `name` * Up
     *         to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area density, independent of `rankby`
     *         parameter. * When using `rankby=distance`, the radius parameter will not be accepted,
     *         and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`. * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters * Text
     *         Search: 50,000 meters
     * @param  sessiontoken  Optional parameter: A random string which identifies an autocomplete
     *         [session](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details#session_tokens)
     *         for billing purposes. The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and
     *         concludes when they select a place and a call to Place Details is made. Each session
     *         can have multiple queries, followed by one place selection. The API key(s) used for
     *         each request within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project.
     *         Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a
     *         fresh token for each session. If the `sessiontoken` parameter is omitted, or if you
     *         reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided
     *         (each request is billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: - Use
     *         session tokens for all autocomplete sessions. - Generate a fresh token for each
     *         session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. - Ensure that the API key(s) used for
     *         all Place Autocomplete and Place Details requests within a session belong to the same
     *         Cloud Console project. - Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session.
     *         Using the same token for more than one session will result in each request being
     *         billed individually.
     * @param  components  Optional parameter: A grouping of places to which you would like to
     *         restrict your results. Currently, you can use components to filter by up to 5
     *         countries. Countries must be passed as a two character, ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 compatible
     *         country code. For example: `components=country:fr` would restrict your results to
     *         places within France. Multiple countries must be passed as multiple `country:XX`
     *         filters, with the pipe character `|` as a separator. For example:
     *         `components=country:us|country:pr|country:vi|country:gu|country:mp` would restrict
     *         your results to places within the United States and its unincorporated organized
     *         territories. &lt;div class="note"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you
     *         receive unexpected results with a country code, verify that you are using a code
     *         which includes the countries, dependent territories, and special areas of
     *         geographical interest you intend. You can find code information at &lt;a
     *         href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes" target="blank"
     *         class="external"&gt;Wikipedia: List of ISO 3166 country codes&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a
     *         href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search" target="blank" class="external"&gt;ISO
     *         Online Browsing Platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
     * @param  strictbounds  Optional parameter: Returns only those places that are strictly within
     *         the region defined by `location` and `radius`. This is a restriction, rather than a
     *         bias, meaning that results outside this region will not be returned even if they
     *         match the user input.
     * @param  offset  Optional parameter: The position, in the input term, of the last character
     *         that the service uses to match predictions. For example, if the input is `Google` and
     *         the offset is 3, the service will match on `Goo`. The string determined by the offset
     *         is matched against the first word in the input term only. For example, if the input
     *         term is `Google abc` and the offset is 3, the service will attempt to match against
     *         `Goo abc`. If no offset is supplied, the service will use the whole term. The offset
     *         should generally be set to the position of the text caret.
     * @param  origin  Optional parameter: The origin point from which to calculate straight-line
     *         distance to the destination (returned as `distance_meters`). If this value is
     *         omitted, straight-line distance will not be returned. Must be specified as
     *         `latitude,longitude`.
     * @param  location  Optional parameter: The point around which to retrieve place information.
     *         This must be specified as `latitude,longitude`. The `radius` parameter must also be
     *         provided when specifying a location. If `radius` is not provided, the `location`
     *         parameter is ignored. &lt;div class="note"&gt;When using the Text Search API, the
     *         `location` parameter may be overriden if the `query` contains an explicit location
     *         such as `Market in Barcelona`.&lt;/div&gt;
     * @param  locationbias  Optional parameter: Prefer results in a specified area, by specifying
     *         either a radius plus lat/lng, or two lat/lng pairs representing the points of a
     *         rectangle. If this parameter is not specified, the API uses IP address biasing by
     *         default. - IP bias: Instructs the API to use IP address biasing. Pass the string
     *         `ipbias` (this option has no additional parameters). - Circular: A string specifying
     *         radius in meters, plus lat/lng in decimal degrees. Use the following format:
     *         `circle:radius{@literal @}lat,lng`. - Rectangular: A string specifying two lat/lng
     *         pairs in decimal degrees, representing the south/west and north/east points of a
     *         rectangle. Use the following format:`rectangle:south,west|north,east`. Note that
     *         east/west values are wrapped to the range -180, 180, and north/south values are
     *         clamped to the range -90, 90.
     * @param  locationrestriction  Optional parameter: Restrict results to a specified area, by
     *         specifying either a radius plus lat/lng, or two lat/lng pairs representing the points
     *         of a rectangle. - Circular: A string specifying radius in meters, plus lat/lng in
     *         decimal degrees. Use the following format: `circle:radius{@literal @}lat,lng`. -
     *         Rectangular: A string specifying two lat/lng pairs in decimal degrees, representing
     *         the south/west and north/east points of a rectangle. Use the following
     *         format:`rectangle:south,west|north,east`. Note that east/west values are wrapped to
     *         the range -180, 180, and north/south values are clamped to the range -90, 90.
     * @param  types  Optional parameter: You can restrict results from a Place Autocomplete request
     *         to be of a certain type by passing the `types` parameter. This parameter specifies a
     *         type or a type collection, as listed in [Place
     *         Types](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types). If nothing is
     *         specified, all types are returned. For the value of the `types` parameter you can
     *         specify either: * Up to five values from [Table
     *         1](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table1) or [Table
     *         2](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table2). For multiple
     *         values, separate each value with a `|` (vertical bar). For example:
     *         `types=book_store|cafe` * Any supported filter in [Table
     *         3](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table3). You can safely mix
     *         the `geocode` and `establishment` types. You cannot mix type collections (`address`,
     *         `(cities)` or `(regions)`) with any other type, or an error occurs. The request will
     *         be rejected with an `INVALID_REQUEST` error if: * More than five types are specified.
     *         * Any unrecognized types are present. * Any types from in [Table
     *         1](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table1) or [Table
     *         2](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table2) are mixed with any
     *         of the filters in [Table
     *         3](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table3).
     * @param  language  Optional parameter: The language in which to return results. * See the
     *         [list of supported
     *         languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often
     *         updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive. * If `language`
     *         is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the
     *         `Accept-Language` header. * The API does its best to provide a street address that is
     *         readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
     *         addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
     *         necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the
     *         preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which
     *         is chosen from the first component. * If a name is not available in the preferred
     *         language, the API uses the closest match. * The preferred language has a small
     *         influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in
     *         which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
     *         on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
     *         valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms
     *         for street in Hungarian.
     * @param  region  Optional parameter: The region code, specified as a [ccTLD ("top-level
     *         domain")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains)
     *         two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some
     *         notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while
     *         its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of
     *         Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
     * @return    Returns the PlacesAutocompleteResponse wrapped in ApiResponse response from the API call
