     * The Time Zone API provides a simple interface to request the time zone for locations on the
     * surface of the earth, as well as the time offset from UTC for each of those locations. You
     * request the time zone information for a specific latitude/longitude pair and date. The API
     * returns the name of that time zone, the time offset from UTC, and the daylight savings
     * offset.
     * @param  location  Required parameter: A comma-separated latitude,longitude tuple,
     *         `location=39.6034810,-119.6822510`, representing the location to look up.
     * @param  timestamp  Required parameter: The desired time as seconds since midnight, January 1,
     *         1970 UTC. The Time Zone API uses the `timestamp` to determine whether or not Daylight
     *         Savings should be applied, based on the time zone of the `location`. Note that the
     *         API does not take historical time zones into account. That is, if you specify a past
     *         timestamp, the API does not take into account the possibility that the location was
     *         previously in a different time zone.
     * @param  language  Optional parameter: The language in which to return results. * See the
     *         [list of supported
     *         languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often
     *         updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive. * If `language`
     *         is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the
     *         `Accept-Language` header. * The API does its best to provide a street address that is
     *         readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
     *         addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
     *         necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the
     *         preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which
     *         is chosen from the first component. * If a name is not available in the preferred
     *         language, the API uses the closest match. * The preferred language has a small
     *         influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in
     *         which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
     *         on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
     *         valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms
     *         for street in Hungarian.
     * @return    Returns the TimeZoneResponse wrapped in ApiResponse response from the API call
     * @throws    ApiException    Represents error response from the server.
     * @throws    IOException    Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred.
